A Python package to allow fast, modular and reproducible generation of publication-grade scientific figures and movies.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of the code to plot data and add significance information (statannot.py) is from statannot https://github.com/webermarcolivier/statannot created by Marc Weber.<br/>

FastFig was used to generate all figures and all movies from Schelski and Bradke 2021:<br/>
