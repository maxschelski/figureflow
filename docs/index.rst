Figureflow
===============

**Figureflow** is a Python package to allow fast, modular and reproducible generation of publication quality scientific figures and movies with only a few lines of code. 

A lot of the code to plot data and add significance information (in statannot.py) is from statannot https://github.com/webermarcolivier/statannot created by Marc Weber.

FigureFlow was used to generate all figures and all movies from Schelski and Bradke 2021 (examples from paper at the bottom of this page):

For any questions or an introduction of how to use the package please contact me via E-Mail to max.schelski@googlemail.com. I am very happy to help people starting to use the package and I am very open to any feedback. 

Examples from Schelski and Bradke 2021 fully generated with the package without Adobe Illustrator etc:
